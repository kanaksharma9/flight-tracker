### âœˆ *Flight Route Tracker Project*  

The *Flight Route Tracker* is a system that tracks real-time or simulated flight paths between different locations. It can visualize flight routes on a map, display information about flights, and analyze flight data. This project can be expanded for academic, travel, or logistics applications.
